# MachineLearning_FakeNewsDetection

The false news phenomenon is growing swiftly as social media and communication technology evolve. There are some challenges due to the lack of resources, including datasets, processing, and analysis techniques. In this research, we present a method for identifying bogus news that is based on machine learning. We used Decision Tree as a classifier as well as other classifiers such as SVM and LogisticRegression, comparing the accuracy of each classifier. We further provide a dataset of authentic and fake news to train the proposed algorithm. Results show how effective the system is.

The proposed methodology for fake news detection using multiple classifiers and selecting the one with the best accuracy can be broken down into the following steps:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
• Load the dataset into a data structure (such as a pandas data frame).
• Clean the data by removing irrelevant columns, duplicates, and null values.
• Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, stemming words, and transforming the text data into numerical vectors using techniques such as TF-IDF.
Step 2: Train-Test Split
• Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
Step 3: Classification
• Train multiple classifiers on the training set using the preprocessed text data.
• Some classifiers that can be used are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.
• Evaluate the performance of each classifier on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Step 4: Selecting the Best Classifier
• Choose the classifier with the highest accuracy on the testing set as the final model for fake news detection.
Step 5: Model Deployment
• Deploy the final model to detect fake news on new data.
